===========

Attune is a game where the player's character is attuned to metals! They can push and pull, from a distance, on metal objects around them, which uses real physics to determine what would happen. To make it more interesting, they can store their weight in carried metal and tap into it at will - store weight to lose weight, tap into it to gain weight.
